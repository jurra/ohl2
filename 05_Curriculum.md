# Open Hardware Leaders Curriculum

### **Week 3: Start testing and validating your ideas**

_You now have a better understanding of your project‚Äôs value proposition and scope of your participation in this program. Taking into account the stage your project is in, you will formulate ideas and concrete tests that will help you make decisions for advancing your project. _

_E.g. if your project has already considerable user validation, and has a prototype, you may want to focus your tests on documentation, raising funds or community building. Also, they might be interested in learning specific tools such as freeCAD, KiCAD, etc._

**Goal of the week: **Learn to design and frame experiments to validate key hypothesis in your project

### **Week 6: Building for open**

_In this week _

_A set of attitudes, values and concrete channels to be reachable and reach also the people that can benefit somehow from the project._

**Goal of the week: **Create entry points for contributors and users (Contributor User channels)/ Websites, issues, repositories, labels, code of conduct.

**Assignments:**



*   Create issues for contributors to jump into your project
*   Write your contribution guidelines 
*   Who is participating and who is not in your project? Think of strategies for engaging and including wider audiences, and define your community guidelines (or code of conduct).
*   If you have new hypothesis and ideas update your canvas. What would you do to validate these ideas, what experiments would you design?

### **Week 7: Designing for community and project sustainability**

_‚ÄúWhat makes open projects open-source is not the platform they use, but the way participation is designed‚Äù_[^1]_. During this week you are going to learn how to help others find & interact with your project and strategies other projects use for keeping community, and therefore the project, active.  _

**Goals of the week:** define your communication channels and learn about different experiences in open source governance and management models, their advantages and disadvantages.

### **Week 8: Peer review**

_Similar to week 4, it is time to share your progress with your fellow cohort mentees! We hope that we covered interesting and useful topics since the last peer review, so that when you revise your project, it will be easy to spot what can be improved and how these improvements will help you in the task to make your project as open and as sustainable as possible._

**Goal of the week: **Expose your work to fellow mentees and get useful feedback to continue working on your project.

**Assignment:**



*   Prepare a max 5‚Äô pitch based on your revised canvas, get feedback on your new assumptions. Your pitch must include your new assumptions about engaging contributors, channels, CoC and community model.

### **Week 9: Roadmapping**

_In the previous week you made a review of your canvas and got feedback on new assumptions. Basically you had the opportunity to go through a small cycle of identifying a problem, making an assumption on how to solve it and finding ways to test it. By reviewing things you can make better decisions on whether to keep or ditch your proposed solution and refine your model._

_This week you are going to be working on creating a [roadmap](https://business-docs.co.uk/document-templates/roadmap-document-templates/what-is-a-project-roadmap/)**. **Basically, you will take time to think about the long term goals for this product (one way to do that is using [theory of change](https://www.theoryofchange.org/what-is-theory-of-change/)), and break it down the way to get there into actionable steps. These steps can be divided into short, mid and long term goals. In GitHub this can be translated into issues and goals in the Kanban board. _

**Goal of the week:** Visualizing your project in short, mid long term management (Time management)

**Assignments: **



*   Create a [Kanban board in github](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards), make it visible for everyone and write down the ultimate goal for your project. 
*   From there work backwards on what needs to happen so that goal is achieved. Once the steps are done, think about how to translate those steps into actionable issues. Don‚Äôt forget to create issues for all levels of contributors!
*   If you have new hypothesis and ideas update your canvas. What would you do to validate these ideas, what experiments would you design?

### **Week 10: Licensing and documentation**

_You have been working hard on designing and building your open project, including how you want people to interact with it and build a community around it. Documentation is probably one of the most unattended and important aspects of this process, it‚Äôs the cooking recipe that will let others replicate and tweak your ideas. Furthermore, choosing the appropriate open licenses will turn this interaction and the future perspectives into a smooth process or a nightmare, in terms of the hardware but also software and content you are producing. _

**Goal of the week: **acquire best practices for hardware documentation and understand the different open licensing options available.

**Assignments:**



*   Check up on documentation
*   Choose a license for your project
*   If you have new hypothesis and ideas update your canvas. What would you do to validate these ideas, what experiments would you design?

### **Week 12: Global sprint**

_Now it's the time to go crazy with your project. In the last weeks you worked a lot on defining your project and opening it up for possible contributors. During the global sprint you will attract contributors to your project from a diversity of open hardware communities to collaboratively work on open tasks. Use the momentum of the community to advance your project. _

**Goal of the week:** Networking, spreading the word and empathizing with potential community members and peers. 

**Goal as a contributor: **Try to find minimum contribution you can make to another mentee‚Äôs project based on your skills, or consider working on something new to learn new skills.
