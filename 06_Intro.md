# Introduction

Open Hardware Leaders is designed to teach you best practices in “working open” while developing your hardware project. It is intended for those starting up or currently leading open projects– project leads, partners, or small groups of co-leaders responsible for project success and growth.

This program was created as a spin-off of the “Open Leaders” mentorship program run by the Mozilla Foundation, a US-based non-profit organization. It has support from members of the broader Mozilla Community but also of other communities in the ‘open’, as reflected by our volunteer mentors and experts. 

The organizers behind the program are people working on a diversity of areas within the Open Hardware community, making an effort to gather the lessons learned along their journey. The program is in itself an open initiative, which hopes to benefit from the ideas, resources and constructive feedback from the wider community.

## Program structure

The content of the program is organized in 14 weeks. 

**Week 0** is aimed to provide the basic concepts and tools all participants need to be aware of before starting the program. **It has to be completed by mentees on their own.** It’s also during week 0 that they’re communicated who their mentor will be, so meetings can be scheduled.

During each of the **Weeks 1-10**, participants will:



*   complete a practical assignment directly related to their project
*   attend either 30’ meetings with their mentor or a cohort meeting according to [the schedule](https://open-hardware-leaders.github.io/ohlwebsite/Program/02_schedule.html)

Completion of the assignments in this series is very important! The work in each assignment represents real, significant work on your project, from project planning to developing good workflows to convening events and communicating effectively with contributors. 


To reinforce the application of the concepts to real life, on **Week 11 **mentees will prepare for participation in a global Sprint to be run on **Week 12**, with the aim of collaborating with outside contributors, contribute to their peer’s projects and promote their own work.

After the sprint, mentees will meet with their mentors on **Week 13 **to reflect on their progress and the future of their project, plus providing feedback on their program experience. **Week 14 **is reserved for a public call, where mentees are invited to run a max 5’ demo of their project (live or recorded, in a format of their preference) to showcase and promote their work. 


Mentor meetings are aimed to work as a checkpoint, guide and support for mentees with their assignments, connecting them with experts inside and outside the program and pointing them to useful resources. These meetings should be documented by the mentee in the meeting notes.
Cohort meetings, every 3 weeks, are designed as a "peer review" exercise, where mentees will interact with each other through specific exercises.




## A note on roles and responsibilities

This program relies on a mentorship methodology to guide mentees along their learning journey. It is important to highlight that mentors are not partners in their mentees’ projects (although they can become if they want to), and they don’t have to necessarily be technical experts in the projects’ fields either. 

Mentors and experts are volunteering their valuable time by participating in Open Hardware Leaders. As mentees, we recommend following some basic etiquette for making the best out of your mentorship experience:



*   Schedule meetings with your mentor with anticipation, and avoid cancelling or rescheduling unless absolutely necessary
*   Prepare for the meeting: what do you want to discuss this week, which resources or experts you need to connect to?
*   Connect 5’ before the scheduled time, make sure your connection and mic settings work: there’s nothing worse than wasting your precious 30’ in technical issues
*   Make sure you have the meeting notes  at hand before starting (find a template to copy [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JnPxxxiNP1xxrHZNWAfK7TsFKSiBpb8T2JkVWZFnbMk/edit?usp=sharing)), and that you document what happens in the meeting (don’t expect your mentor to do it)

In week 7, both mentors and mentees will have the chance to complete a mid-term survey to share their feedback on the mentorship experience. Both mentors and mentees can communicate anytime with the organizers at [openhardware4me@gmail.com](mailto:openhardware4me@gmail.com) if any inconveniences arise.
